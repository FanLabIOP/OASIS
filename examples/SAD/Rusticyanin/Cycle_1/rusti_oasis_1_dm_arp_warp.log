Building free atoms model.
<!--SUMMARY_END--></FONT></B>

 Initial map calculated, amplitude weighted by extra weight ...
 ... and extended to AU
 Now building 1 initial model(s)
 Had to go as low as 0.25 sigma, to complete atoms search.


<B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><!--SUMMARY_BEGIN-->
  ARP will be iterated with REFMAC 5.
  50 ARP refinement cycles will be run in total.
  Atoms will be removed if below 0.9 sigmas in 2mFoDFc map.
  Atoms will be added if above 3.2 sigmas in mFoDFc map.

  Refmac Refinement Parameters
    3 REFMAC cycle(s) with  0.4 0.4  fractional shifts damping in each ARP cycle.
    Weight for restraints is set to AUTO 
    FreeR will be used for monitoring and sigmaa calculations.
    Anisotropic scaling with bulk solvent correction

  Autobuilding Parameters
    Autobuilding will take place every 5 ARP cycles.
    Side chain docking will be performed from autobuilding cycle number 0
    The Depth first search (NEW) autobuilding algorithm will be used.
